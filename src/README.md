- count_symptoms_per_country(list)        	 # iterate trough list and count number of each symptom 

- find_most_common_symptom_per_country(list)	 # iterate trough list and find most common symptom for country

- find_most_common_symptom_per_age(list)       # iterate trough list and find most common symptom per age

- don_t_show_selected_symptoms(symptoms, data) # avoid multiple selection of symptoms on main page
