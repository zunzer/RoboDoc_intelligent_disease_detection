{"Description": "A strain is a hardening of muscles; regional supporting tissue refers to the chest muscles. Strain of the regional supporting tissue is therefore a hardening of chest muscles. Continuous and one-sided usage of the chest muscles, but also metabolic disorders can cause muscle hardening. The hardening causes patients to experience pain during certain movements or breathing, or a permanent pain.", "DescriptionShort": "A strain is among the most frequent causes of pain regarding muscles. A strain of the regional supporting tissue means that the chest muscles are hard and cannot relax normally. The pain is sharp when the strain occurs and it is difficult for the patient to breathe normally.", "MedicalCondition": "People who are repeatedly doing monotonous movements during their job or hobby are often affected by strains. Sometimes athletes are affected as well, either because they repeatedly did the same movement (e.g. rowers) or because they overstrained a joint, which will reflectively lead to a hardening of nearby muscles.", "Name": "Strain of the regional supporting tissue", "PossibleSymptoms": "Chest pain", "ProfName": "Tenseness of the regional pectoral tissue", "Synonyms": null, "TreatmentDescription": "Heat treatment of the affected muscle parts is often sufficient, e.g. warm compresses, hot-water-bottle, heat plasters or -ointments. Massaging the chest muscles can resolve the hardening gradually. If the pain is too strong, painkillers can be prescribed as well. Generally, a strain of the regional supporting tissue improves very fast."}
