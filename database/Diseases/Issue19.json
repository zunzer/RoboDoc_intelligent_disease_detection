Because lung cancer (see: lung carcinoma) often does not cause any complaints until late, it is often discovered at a stage, where the disease can no longer be cured. Damage to the organs is caused by various highly poisonous substances that are found in tobacco smoke. Smoking not only does the smoker harm, but also people in their surroundings due to passive smoking. It should be noted that even tobacco smoke that is passively inhaled contains poisonous substances that are even more concentrated than smoke that passes through a filter.
