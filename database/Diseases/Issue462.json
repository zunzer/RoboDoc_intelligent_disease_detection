On contact with the allergen the immune system then starts to release histamine, which will lead to a process of inflammation and the typical symptoms. Examples of allergic rhinitis include: 1) Seasonal allergic rhinitis, which often results from pollen of trees and herbs that are spread in the air when the plant is blooming. This form of rhinitis is also known as hay fever. 2) Perennial allergic rhinitis, which often results from mold, dust mites and dander of animals. The common symptoms include itching in the nose, sneezing, stuffy and runny nose. Because the allergic reaction mostly also affects the conjunctivae, red and tearing eyes with dark circles around are a common symptom in allergic rhinitis. Non-allergic rhinitis:  the causes of non-allergic rhinitis are various. Viral infections, such as the flu or a cold, are common reasons.
