But there are two types of stress with different meanings: 1) Eustress describes the positive stress, which encourages people to achieve more than usual. It may lead to a feeling of satisfaction. 2) Distress describes the negative stress that is felt to be threatening or overstraining. This sort of stress can be produced by seriously dangerous situations like an accident, war or a natural disaster. But also less disastrous situations, like problems in the job or family, can lead to distress, when there is no compensation for stress or when a person feels helpless and does not know a way to handle with it. When a stress response is triggered, a series of changes will occur within the human body. For example: 1) a rise in pulse rate, 2) redirection of blood away from the extremities and to the major organs, and 3) release of cortisone, adrenalin and noradrenalin, which may cause physical and mental short and long term changes. However, the symptoms caused by stress will differ from person to person. Some people will feel physical symptoms such as headache, pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea or dizziness. And some may have mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and loss of sexual drive. Chronic distress may lead to a so called burnout-syndrome.", "Name": "State of stress", "PossibleSymptoms": "Reduced appetite,Increased appetite,Weight loss,Weight gain,Difficulty to concentrate,Headache,Nervousness,Sleeplessness,Forgetfulness,Anxiety,Itching of skin,Hair loss,Bold area among hair on the head,Neck pain", "ProfName": "Stress", "Synonyms": "Stress state", "TreatmentDescription": "Strategies for stress relief (coping) will differ from person to person, but making certain lifestyle changes will be a good start.
