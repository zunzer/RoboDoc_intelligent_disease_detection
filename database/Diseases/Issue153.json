{"Description": "Acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi. 90% of all acute bronchitis cases are an inflammation of the trachea or the bronchi due to a virus.  Less than 10% of all bronchitis cases are bacterial.  Still, a viral infection can allow a bacterial infection to set in, in which case it is referred to as a superinfection.", "DescriptionShort": "Acute bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchial tubes), causing them to become inflamed and irritated. The condition occurs usually due to a viral infection of the chest involving a cold and can have numerous types of viruses as a trigger. It generally heals within 8 or 10 days without complication.", "MedicalCondition": "Acute bronchitis is transmitted via moisture droplets in the air. It usually begins with sniffling and dry, coughs.  Burning or cramping pains sometimes develop in the trachea. Hoarseness may be present. After several days, the dry cough turns into a productive cough with white or yellowish sputum. If the color of the sputum turns green, that\u2019s a sign of a superinfection.
