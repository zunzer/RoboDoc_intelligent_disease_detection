{"Description": "Kidney stones have various causes and can affect any part of the urinary tract, from the kidneys to the bladder. The stones are usually forming whenever a person's urine becomes more concentrated, which in turn allows the minerals stick together by crystallization. Often kidney stones produce no symptoms at all, however they may be pretty painful when they pass outwards of the body. They normally leave no permanent damage behind.", "DescriptionShort": "Kidney stones are small and hard stones found in the renal pelvis or in the urinary tract. They are composed of acid and mineral salts and the stones can get stuck in the urinary tract causing strong and cramping pains.", "MedicalCondition": "When kidney stones reach the urinary tract and get stuck (where they are called urinary stones) they produce severe cramping pains (called renal colic), which can radiate out of the flank to belly or groin. Movement of the stones along the urinary tract lead to small injuries of the mucus membrane in the urinary tract, which causes bleeding and turns urine light pink.", "Name": "Kidney stones", "PossibleSymptoms": "Side pain,Dark urine,Painful urination,Abdominal pain,Testicular pain,Burning sensation when urinating,Back pain,Chills,Nausea,Vomiting,Lower-back pain,Lower abdominal pain,Fever,Distended abdomen", "ProfName": "Nephrolithiasis in women", "Synonyms": null, "TreatmentDescription": "Treatment consists of reducing complaints using painkillers and observing the patient. Small urinary stones generally flow out on their own and can be \u201cstrained\u201d out with the urine. Larger stones, however need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope. Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine to back up or they may cause an infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys."}
