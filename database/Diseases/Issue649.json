{"Description": "Hemoptysis is the medical term for bloody mucus that is coughed or expelled from the respiratory tract. It may be caused by various diseases and is possibly life-threatening. It can be either recurrent or to a limited extent. Sometimes, hemoptysis can be extensive with 200 to 600 ml of blood released within a day. Even if the blood loss is dangerous, choking is the principal danger. Hemoptysis or coughing up blood can indicate a severe medical issue. The condition happens when small blood vessels in the airways of lungs are damaged. When hemoptysis comes from inflamed bronchial tubes due to bronchitis, it can be harmless. However, the condition can be serious when it comes from cancer in the lung. Small amounts of blood is not dangerous compared to huge amounts of blood coughed up. The patient can have pain in the chest but doesn't need to.", "DescriptionShort": "When bloody mucus or even blood is expelled from the respiratory tract, it is referred to as hemoptysis or lung bleeding.

In the case of lung bleeding, doctors may introduce oxygen, try to discover where the bleeding is originating from and stop it bronchoscopically. If this doesn\u2019t work surgery may be required. If the bleeding is kept under control the underlying disease will be treated. With male smokers over 45 years of age, cancer is the most likely cause of hemoptysis."}
