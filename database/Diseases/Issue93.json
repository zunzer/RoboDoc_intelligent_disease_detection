Men can also have an iron deficiency and upon further investigation it is usually discovered that there is an issue of iron absorption or bleeding somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Besides an iron deficiency, a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folic acid can also be a cause of anemia. Genetic diseases that can cause anemia, such as thalassemia are rare.
